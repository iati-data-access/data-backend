These are to be made available from the new Global Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (FPCRTF). This additional financing and financing of the new project, will constitute the Bank's overall support of the Republic of Liberia's Food Crisis Response Program (LFCW). The proposed Liberia Food Crisis Response Program (LFCRP) will help finance activities to mitigate both the short-term and the medium-to long-term impact of rising food prices in Liberia as a result of the global food price trends. The proposed interventions will support the Government of Liberia's (GoL's) national strategy to maintain and enhance food security. It includes support to: (i) the implementation of social safety net measures to maintain access to food among the most vulnerable households; and (ii) expedite a supply response of agricultural production through the implementation of measures to raise the yields and consequently the production of staples. The government focuses on three pillars: (a) mitigating the domestic pass-through of global price rises and ensuring consistent supply of imported foods in the future. Measures include: (i) removing tariffs on rice imports; and (ii) reducing the risk of supply interruptions by negotiating supply contracts with friendly governments; (b) maintaining access to food among vulnerable households by a combination of direct assistance to severely vulnerable households (including IDPs) and targeted feeding programs such as school feeding and supplementary feeding for pregnan","This project paper concerns support for a Liberia Emergency Food Crisis Response Program consisting of (i) additional financing to the Liberia Emergency Agriculture and Infrastructure Development Project, (ii) additional financing for the Second Liberia Community Empowerment Project, and (iii) a grant for a new Liberia Emergency Food Support Project for vulnerable women and children.
